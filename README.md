A phishing email URL dataset is a structured and carefully curated collection of URLs extracted from both malicious phishing emails and legitimate email messages, created to support cybersecurity research, email filtering, and machine-learning-based detection systems. It typically contains the full URL, domain, protocol, path, and structural characteristics of each link, along with email metadata such as sender information, subject lines, and relevant header or body text that help contextualize how the URL was delivered. Each entry is labelled to indicate whether it represents a phishing attempt or a harmless, legitimate link, where phishing samples are marked as malicious and benign samples are marked with zero-attack values. These zero-attack values represent normal behaviour in the dataset and include URLs that do not contain any threat, redirection trick, social engineering pattern, or malware-related activity. Including such benign samples is crucial for building reliable machine learning models because a detection system must understand what safe, everyday email traffic looks like in order to accurately differentiate between malicious and non-malicious patterns. A well-designed phishing email URL dataset therefore provides a balance of attack and non-attack examples, enabling classification algorithms, anomaly detectors, and threat-intelligence systems to learn URL behaviours, identify unusual structures, analyse temporal patterns, and detect zero-day phishing attacks by contrasting malicious link characteristics against a baseline of zero-attack, legitimate email URLs. Through this structure, the dataset becomes an essential asset for developing, training, testing, and benchmarking cybersecurity models, supporting research on social engineering, improving email gateway defences, and enhancing the real-world robustness of phishing detection mechanisms across modern digital communication environments.
